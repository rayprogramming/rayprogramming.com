4/5 stars

This blend reminds me of Captain Black, in it's mild nature, but does have some hints of chocolate similar to the Captain's hint of vanilla. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 is the weakness of the nicotine.

## Thoughts
First impressions are crucial, and this one left a decent one. I'll be honest, this was not what I was looking for when I made the purchase, but my budget and supplies were both running low for this month, so I decided to explore the local cheaper products. This one was exceeded what I was expecting out of the product. It was 18 USD for a 12 oz bag.

The tobacco was rather moist coming out of the thick plastic bag, almost to a sticky point. And I suppose that would be the downside with the Classic Black. It is a little on the messy side. However, the very mild notes, flavors, and smoke to it are something that makes up for any downsides. I smoke for the nicotine more than I do the enjoyment, and this one is a little weak for my tastes, but given my constraints this month I am happy with it. I used to keep a can of Captain Black around for situations like this, but I think this one will be able to make an easy alternative.
