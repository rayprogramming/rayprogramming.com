3/5 stars

The mellow nature of this really saved the review here. The cut is what tanked it.

## Thoughts
I want to start off with, I purchased 16 oz of what was supposed to be loose cut, but it seemed a lot closer to shag cut. I am not thrilled with the smoking experience of this type of cut. Regarding the smoke of the rest of the stats. Well they fit pretty well. I can't complain too much there. The nicotine in this one seems to be on the lower side as I need more of it. However, with how easy of a smoke (beyond the shag cut) it is I am happy to go back to it often. This one will eat through your filter supply though. The gunk builds up quick on the filter and makes for very tight draws; this caused me to end up just smoking it without the filters.
