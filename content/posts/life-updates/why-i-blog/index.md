### Who am I?
Sometimes I don't know who I am to an extent that I would be happy with the answer. At this time I am a father, a husband, a programmer, and an automation lover. I hate to see inefficient things in code when I know that there are so many better options out there.

### So why do I blog?
Because I can. No seriously. I'm bored, and I need something better to do with my time then playing games that cause too much frustration, browsing social media until I feel like a zombie, or watch shows that just drag and can't keep my attention. I figured this was a good way to get my thoughts out of my head and into a more active way of spending my time.

### What will I talk about?
What ever I want. But generally I am going to be focused on trying to write about the different things I work on or accomplish. I may think of ideas every now and then that I will want to try to work on, and might publish here. I don't have major plans for the site just yet, but I am liking the ease that this static site generator was able to provide me with.
