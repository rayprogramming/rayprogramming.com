At the beginning of August I set a goal: publish a blog post every week for eight weeks.  I've never managed to maintain a consistent writing schedule before, so this was a personal challenge as much as a professional one.  Now that the eighth post is live, I want to look back at what worked, what didn't and where I'm headed next.

## Highlights

- **Planning helps.**  I drafted a content calendar at the start of the experiment.  Knowing what topic I was going to tackle each week reduced decision fatigue and prevented last‑minute scrambles.
- **Mixing personal and technical content keeps things fresh.**  Some weeks I wrote about Terraform modules and serverless architectures; other weeks I opened up about mental health and life updates.  This balance kept me engaged and seemed to resonate with readers.
- **Learning by teaching.**  Writing posts like the Terraform vs CDK comparison forced me to articulate why I choose certain tools.  Explaining concepts solidified my own understanding and uncovered gaps in my knowledge.

## Challenges

- **Time management.**  Even with planning, writing a thoughtful post takes time—often more than I expected.  There were nights when I questioned whether anyone would care if I skipped a week.  (Spoiler: someone always notices!)
- **Imposter syndrome.**  Hitting publish is scary.  Sharing opinions on infrastructure or talking about personal struggles invites judgement.  I had to remind myself that my perspective has value and that vulnerability fosters connection.

## Looking ahead

Blogging weekly has reignited my passion for writing.  I intend to continue posting regularly, though I may switch to a bi‑weekly cadence to allow deeper dives into complex topics.  Upcoming ideas include a series on Kubernetes networking, an exploration of Rust for infrastructure tooling and maybe even a few guest posts from colleagues.

If you've been following along, thank you.  Your comments and messages motivate me to keep sharing.  And if you're thinking about starting your own writing journey, my advice is simple: pick a cadence, outline a few topics and hit publish.  You'll be surprised at how much you learn along the way.
