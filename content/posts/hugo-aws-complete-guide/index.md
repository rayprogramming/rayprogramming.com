Welcome to the complete guide for deploying Hugo sites on AWS! This comprehensive series covers everything from basic CI/CD automation to production-grade infrastructure with security, monitoring, and global distribution.

## Architecture Overview

Our complete setup provides a robust, secure, and globally distributed static site hosting solution:

## What You'll Learn

This guide is structured as a progressive journey from basic automation to enterprise-grade infrastructure:

### Part 1: [CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions](./github-actions-cicd/)
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated Hugo builds
- Configure AWS OIDC for secure, keyless authentication
- Deploy to S3 with proper IAM permissions
- Implement scheduled publishing with Hugo's `publishDate`

### Part 2: [Complete AWS Infrastructure](./aws-infrastructure/)
- Set up Route 53 for custom domain management
- Configure CloudFront for global content delivery
- Implement SSL/TLS with AWS Certificate Manager
- Advanced caching strategies and performance optimization

### Part 3: [Security with AWS WAF](./aws-waf-security/)
- Deploy AWS WAF for web application protection
- Configure rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Implement IP allowlists/blocklists
- Set up security monitoring and alerting

### Part 4: [Monitoring and Operations](./monitoring-operations/)
- CloudWatch dashboards and custom metrics
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) integration
- Automated health checks and alerting
- Performance optimization based on analytics

## Key Benefits

This architecture provides:

- **🔒 Security First**: OIDC authentication, WAF protection, and encrypted communications
- **🌍 Global Performance**: CloudFront edge locations for worldwide content delivery
- **📊 Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **💰 Cost Effective**: Pay-as-you-go pricing with CloudFront free tier
- **🔄 Automation**: Fully automated CI/CD with infrastructure as code
- **📈 Scalable**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **🛡️ Resilient**: Multi-region redundancy and DDoS protection

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, ensure you have:

1. **Hugo site** in a GitHub repository
2. **AWS account** with administrative permissions
3. **Domain name** that you can configure DNS for
4. **Terraform** installed locally (version >= 1.0)
5. **Basic knowledge** of Git, YAML, and HCL syntax

## Infrastructure Components

Our complete setup includes:

| Component | Purpose | Cost Impact |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **S3 Bucket** | Static file storage | ~$0.02/GB/month |
| **CloudFront** | Global CDN | Free tier: 1TB + 10M requests |
| **Route 53** | DNS management | $0.50/month + $0.40/million queries |
| **ACM Certificate** | SSL/TLS encryption | Free with CloudFront |
| **AWS WAF** | Web application firewall | $1/month + $0.60/million requests |
| **CloudWatch** | Monitoring & alerting | Free tier: 10 metrics |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD pipeline | 2,000 minutes/month free |

> **Estimated monthly cost for a personal blog**: $2-5/month depending on traffic

## Security Considerations

This guide emphasizes security best practices:

- **No long-lived AWS credentials** in GitHub
- **Principle of least privilege** for IAM roles
- **Encrypted data in transit and at rest**
- **WAF protection** against common web attacks
- **DDoS mitigation** through CloudFront and WAF
- **Regular security monitoring** and alerting

## Getting Started

Begin with [Part 1: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions](./github-actions-cicd/) to set up your automated deployment pipeline, then progress through each part to build a complete, production-ready hosting solution.

Each part builds on the previous one, but you can also jump to specific sections if you already have some components in place.
