### Where did I go wrong?!
Well, as I stated in [Disabling Jenkins Security]({{< relref "disable-security" >}}) I am not experienced in managing Jenkins servers to the degree that I would like. And so when I perform updates I like to create an AMI backup and spin that one up to be able to test upgrades of packages and Jenkins itself. Once I started up the AMI I tried to access it with it's public dns record. The only issue was it kept redirecting me over to the production version's domain name.

I knew that Jenkins stored a lot of values in files, but surely it must be in the `config.yaml` right? NOPE! It was in a much more obvious place. `jenkins.model.JenkinsLocationConfiguration.xml` Looking back I am not sure how I was so blind to it, but sure enough it was right there.

### Why blog this?
Honestly, because I needed to rant about my oblivious nature a bit. But, and more importantly, I wanted to have a record to help me remember and collect my thoughts if I ever miss something like this again.
