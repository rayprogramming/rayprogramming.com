5/5 stars

Man does this smell take me back! I grew up around a circus, and one whiff of this really shoots me back to the smell of that hay. The flavor, and strong nicotine content really sets this one apart for me.

## Thoughts
I am going to have to disagree with the site where I purchased this on the room notes and flavor intensity. But only slightly. I find that this tends to be one of my go to choices. I just wish that I could find a more consistent supply. The last tin I bought of this was dryer than a sun baked bone. It crumbled in my hands. I have bought this previously, and the first couple I got had a consistent and perfect moisture content to allow for a smooth smoke.
